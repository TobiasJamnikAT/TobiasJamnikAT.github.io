      <h2>Dynasty</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>The most important part, from my point of view, about the entire game is the dynasty you create. You can be the greatest and strongest leader ever to exist, but eventually you will pass away, and your heir will take over. If you are not careful about building your dynasty, your legacy will crumble.</p>
      <br>
      <p>
        In order to have a good heir, you need to be careful choosing your wife. The most important perk of each wife are inheritable trades. The better the traits of your current character and the once of your wife, the better inheritable trades your heir will have. If the current ruler is a Genius, but his wife is nowhere near being intelligent, it is quite a gamble for your children to be equally gifted. Instead, if you choose a wife that is intelligent as well, the chance of your heir filling his father's shoes is pretty high.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Even if your heir has inherited great trades, the education of the future ruler is very important. A well forged blade that is not treaded well, will not cut. Therefore, it is always important to start teaching your children as soon as possible, by the greatest minds at your court. In addition to that, it is also important to send your children to university. Even though this is very expensive, it will be a worthwhile investment for the future of your dynasty.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Sometimes a problem arises on splitting your realm between your heirs. The optimal situation would be having only one great heir inheriting all the holdings. Choosing a female as a ruler might be problematic, due to cultural conflicts. If you have more than one son, disinheriting every one, except one, would be the way to go. If disinheriting is not possible, there are other ways of dealing with this problem. Forcing the bad sons to fight in war or sending them on impossible missions would be one such method. Even though this might seem cruel, it is the best for the dynasty. If more than one son inherits, there is a significant chance of war breaking out within the family.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Summing up, building a dynasty that will last centuries is the most important challenge of the entire game. Make sure to have one heir in power and to control the others, in order to keep peace and stay strong within the dynasty.
