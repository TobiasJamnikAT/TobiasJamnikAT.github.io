        To initiate your ascent to the top of the world, it is important to organize your initial holdings. You can select any territory within the boundaries of the map that suits your preference. Regardless of whether you start as an emperor, king, duke or count, it ultimately boils down to effectively managing each domain. As your realm grows, the number of domains you need to manage also increases.

        Depending on the location where you begin, there are various governing systems in place. In Central Europe, the classic feudal system is prevalent, while the tribal system is widespread in the northern regions of Europe and Africa. The clan system is typically found in the eastern parts of the map.

        The tribal system is the oldest governing system, where money is not the most crucial factor. The ruler relies on prestige and warfare to gain recognition. Gaining prestige can be accomplished by winning wars or pillages. The prestige can then be utilized to construct buildings that boost monthly income, troops, and of course, prestige. The benefit of the tribal system is that it is less reliant on money, with prestige being the most important currency. Additionally, armies in the tribal system are stronger and larger in comparison to other governing systems, making pillaging easier. However, the major downside of this system is that developing your own land for future-proofing is almost impossible. Therefore, it is advisable to remain in this system for a maximum of 100 years, take over significant portions of the surrounding areas, and then convert to the feudal system. Even though developing domains is not as effective in this system, it should not be disregarded since it eases the process of transitioning to other systems.

        In Central Europe, the feudal system is the most widespread. Unlike the tribal system, it solely relies on money. Building structures, purchasing troops, and expanding armies only require money, not prestige. Hence, money becomes the most significant factor in governing. Therefore, it is essential to construct facilities that enhance your income. A stable cash flow enables the ruler to construct more buildings, increase army size, and conquer more land. The newly acquired land must be developed to boost monthly income, which creates an endless cycle of taking, developing, and defending land to secure more revenue sources.

        The clan system is akin to the feudal system, with the primary difference being that women cannot rule. The buildings that can be purchased with gold have slightly different perks and appearances, but everything else is nearly identical to the feudal system.
